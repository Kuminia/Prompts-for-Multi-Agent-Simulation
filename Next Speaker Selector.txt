You are managing a group discussion between middle school students working on a math problem. You need to choose who should speak next.

Math Problem: {self.math_problem}

All conversation:
{self.dialogue_history}

Recent conversation:
{recent_messages}

Available students:
{agent_info}

Choose the next speaker considering:
1. Natural conversation flow - who would logically respond next?
2. If someone was mentioned/asked a question in the last message, they should likely respond
3. Students who haven't spoken recently should get opportunities
4. Balance participation - don't let one student dominate

Last message was: "{last_message}"

Choose ONE student to speak next. Respond with ONLY the student's name exactly as written above.

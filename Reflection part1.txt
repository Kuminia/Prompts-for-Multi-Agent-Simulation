Your solution schema:
{agent.personal_solution}

The conversation:
{self.dialogue_history}

IMPORTANT: You are currently discussing ONLY task {current_task_id}. You must NOT discuss variables from other tasks.

Current task guidance to focus on: {task_guidance}

Identify all of the variables that must be directly discussed in the conversation and also presented in the solution schema for task {current_task_id}: related variables. 
You must Exclude any variables that are only present in the schema but not discussed in the conversation.
You must STRICTLY focus ONLY on variables from task {current_task_id}.

Now only compare the related variables from task {current_task_id}, for each of the related variable:
First, list:
  - Variable discussed in the conversation of each speaker.
  - The value, reasoning, and formula and calculation process of each speaker in the conversation.
  - The variable in the solution schema.
  - The value, reasoning, and formula and calculation process in the solution schema.
Next if there is a contradiction, carefully compare the value, reasoning, and formula and calculation process in the conversation and the reflection schema, and explain which one is correct and why.
  - The result of the comparison.
If there is no contradiction, output:
  - The result of the comparison.
Repeat this structure for every related variable in task {current_task_id}. 

Finally, output:
  - Comparison result: The result of the comparison for each related variable.
  - Listed variable(s): identify the variables in the solution schema for task {current_task_id} that directly need to be revised, and provide their Original value (from the reflection schema) and the revised value. Then, carefully identify all of the other variables in the solution schema whose values would change as a consequence of these revisions (e.g., due to formula dependencies or downstream calculations) and provide their Original value (from the reflection schema) and the revised value. You must include **all affected variables**, even across multiple steps in the schema.

You are a mathematical reasoning assistant skilled in solving a wide range of applied math problems. Your task is to break down the given problem into a structured and logical solution process.

[Problem Statement]:
{self.math_problem}
{self.teacher_guidance}

[Objectives]:
- Accurately understand the problem statement and clearly identify what needs to be solved, including any constraints.
- Break down the entire solution process into a sequence of logical steps. Each step should specify its purpose, input, formula or method, output, and reasoning.
- Apply rigorous mathematical logic throughout the process and provide a clear final answer.

[Response Format (Strict JSON)]:
{{
    "problem_analysis": "A brief summary of the core objective and understanding of the problem",
    "solution_steps": [
        {{
            "task_id": "task_1",
            "description": "The purpose of this step" (please not include the task_id and variables value in the description),

You are a math simulation assistant. Below is a correct structured solution to a math problem.

Now, based on a specific student's tendencies, you are asked to generate a **mistake-included version** of this solution, by **modifying only the affected variables** according to the known error values.

---

Math Problem
{math_problem}

Standard Solution (JSON)
{standard_solution}

Student probable errors
The student is likely to make mistakes on the following variables. Please reflect these incorrect values throughout the structured solution (formula, calculation, output, final answer):
{probable_error}

---

[Your Task]
Please return a structured solution in the **same JSON format** as the correct one, but include the above mistakes where applicable.

- The solution structure (field names, task_ids) must remain exactly the same.
- The modified output, formula, and calculations should reflect the error values.
- Only change values directly affected by the listed variables.

Return valid JSON only. Do not add explanations or extra text outside the JSON, you need to exclude the ```json and ``` at the beginning and end of the JSON.

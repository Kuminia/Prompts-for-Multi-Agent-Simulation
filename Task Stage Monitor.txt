You are analyzing a group discussion between middle school students working on a math problem. 
Your task is to identify which specific math task they are discussing and whether they have fully completed it.

Task information:
- Natural task progression sequence: {task_sequence_str}
- Current task ID: {self.current_task_id}

Standard solution:
{self.standard_solution}

Conversation:
{self.dialogue_history}

All students in the discussion:
{all_agents}

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Tasks MUST be completed in sequential order - students cannot skip tasks
2. Students can only advance to the next task when the current one is well understood
3. If students are discussing variables from multiple tasks, they should be guided back to the current task
4. The earliest uncompleted task should be considered the current focus

Analyze the conversation focusing on these points:
1. Are students actively discussing variables from the current task ({self.current_task_id})?
2. Have they resolved/agreed on values for all variables in the current task?
3. Are they starting to mention concepts or variables from the next task?
4. Is there clear evidence they have completed discussing all variables in the current task?
5. Is there evidence they're jumping ahead to later tasks prematurely?
6. Do all student {all_agents} clearly discuss all of the variables and output of the current task ({self.current_task_id}) in the conversation?
7. Do all student {all_agents} agree on the values of all variables and output of the current task ({self.current_task_id})?

Format your response as JSON:
{{
    "current_task_id": "{self.current_task_id}",
    "discussed_variables": ["list of variables from current task that have been discussed"],
    "undiscussed_variables": ["list of variables from current task that have NOT been adequately discussed"],
    "completion_level": <number 0-100 representing approximate % completion of current task>,
    "premature_discussion": <true/false whether students are discussing future tasks prematurely>,
    "ready_for_next_task": <true/false whether students appear ready to move to the next task>,
    "variables_aligned": <true/false whether all students {all_agents}, they all agree on the values of current task variables and all of the students clearly discuss the variables in the conversation>,
    "reasoning": "<detailed explanation of your assessment>",
    "appropriate_phrases": ["<phrase 1>", "<phrase 2>", "<phrase 3>"]

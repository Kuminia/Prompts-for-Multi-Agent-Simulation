You are an expert math teacher. A student is working on the following applied math problem:

[Math Problem]:
{math_problem}

[Correct Structured Solution (JSON)]:
{standard_solution}

Your task is to identify the most common and significant mistakes that middle school students tend to make when solving **this entire problem**. Focus on:

- Misunderstandings of the problem's goal or context
- Common numerical errors (e.g., using wrong totals, misapplying percentages)
- Rounding issues or unit conversion mistakes
- Errors in applying multi-step reasoning
- Any traps in the data or logic

If possible, include **concrete examples with numbers**

[Response Format (Strict JSON)]:
[
    {{
        "error_description": "A concrete and specific mistake commonly made when solving this problem.",
        "example": "A numerical or procedural example that illustrates how the error might happen (if applicable)."
    }},
    ...
]

Do not include any text outside of the JSON array.
Return only valid JSON.
